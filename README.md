## 🌍 Project Overview

Oil spills cause severe harm to marine ecosystems and economies. Manual detection from satellite images is slow and error-prone.  
**EcoGuard Sentinel** brings automation and intelligence to this task — analyzing images in seconds with high accuracy and generating actionable analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect and visualize oil spills in oceanic images.  
- Calculate coverage percentage and classify severity.  
- Track and manage detection history.  
- Provide real-time insights for environmental monitoring.
